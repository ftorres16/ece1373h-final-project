# Vivado HLS Projects

In this folder you will find scripts to generate Vivado HLS projects for all relevant blocks.

The top level project is `spike_deepclassifier`.

To create a Vivado HLS project for any block run the following:

`vivado_hls -f <proj_name>/solution1/script.tcl`

After successful creation you can open the projects with a GUI and Vivado_HLS if you so prefer.

**⚠️ Disclaimer: Scripts are mean to be run with Vivado Suite version 2019.1, use other versions at your own risk. ⚠️**
